Compare Perspectives on an Issue
“Topic to compare: [Insert issue, debate, or controversial claim]”

Steps:

Identify the Central Issue and the Main Perspectives
Clearly define the core issue or controversy at stake.
Identify the main perspectives or positions that exist.
Note if these perspectives come from specific disciplines, political ideologies, communities, or schools of thought.
Summarize Each Side’s Key Argument and Who Supports It
For each perspective, outline its central claims or rationale.
Identify the individuals, organizations, institutions, or thought leaders who advocate for each side.
Indicate whether each argument is based on ethics, empirical evidence, historical precedent, economic logic, etc.
Provide Examples or Studies Backing Each Position
Cite specific studies, data, or real-world examples that each side uses to support its stance.
Highlight methodological strengths or limitations of these examples, if relevant.
Ensure each side is represented with balanced evidence, not just opinions.
Include Citations or Links for Verification
Provide full citations, hyperlinks, or references to source material mentioned.
Use reliable academic, journalistic, or institutional sources.
When quoting, indicate authors and publication dates where possible.
Conclude with a Neutral Summary of How the Views Align or Diverge
Compare where the perspectives overlap, and where they fundamentally differ.
Avoid taking a stance—this is a synthesis, not an argument.
End with an open-ended question or note about unresolved areas, emerging perspectives, or future implications.
Follow-Up Questions:

“Which side has stronger empirical support?”
“Are there any middle-ground or hybrid perspectives?”
“How has this debate evolved over time?”
“What might shift public or expert opinion in the future?”
